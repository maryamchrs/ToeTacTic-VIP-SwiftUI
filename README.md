## A Fresh Take on Tic-Tac-Toe with VIP Architecture
This project offers a delightful twist on the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, challenging traditional concepts of winning and losing.
Initially developed using SwiftUI and the MVVM pattern ([link](https://github.com/maryamchrs/Toe-Tac-Tic)), I've created a new version that leverages the VIP (View-Interactor-Presenter) architecture.
This repository is perfect for those who want to explore and become familiar with the integration of SwiftUI and VIP, offering a modern approach to building robust iOS applications.
